# Meeting Report - November 9, 2023
## Content
This afternoon, I met with Claudia via a Teamscall. She currently resides in Peru, so the time difference had to be taken into account. We started off with discussing the current flow of events. Claudia showed me the structure of the *config.xml* file she uses to configure the dashboard pages. There are pros and cons to this method: She indicated that she likes the fact that the whole configuration resides in a single file, but a dashboard page with plenty of graphs can quickly turn the config file into chaos. She also showed me a tool some students from DI developed a year or two ago, that offers a GUI-solution for generating the config.xml file. Claudia pointed out that this tool offers her a convenient solution for quickly reading out names of columns etc, but she didn't really use it for editing and maintaining the dashboards.

Judging from the input I received, Claudia likes working with the xml-format but sometimes struggles with quickly accessing data from the .csv. We brainstormed about possible solutions and I suggested her to split things in two parts:
1. Researching the most convenient ways of creating, editing and mainting her dashboard pages (xml or other) = PRIO
2. Researching/creating a csv reader

At this point in time, my tasks are to provide Nele & Steff a list of possible visualisations AND Claudia with a couple of small demo projects in which she can test the dynamic creation of dashboards. After a selection is made on the preferred graphs and a decision is made concerning the dashboard creation method, I can start with developing their wishes.
