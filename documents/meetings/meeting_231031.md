# Meeting Report - October 31, 2023
## Content
Today I visited Nele and Steff at their co-working space in Leuven. The goal of this meeting was to check wether or not they have access to the source code of their dashboard configuration software. Since I'm still looking for the optimal way for loading in .csv-data, being able to see how that is handled in the source code could have proven really helpful. Unfortunately, Steff only had admin rights to the AWS control panel in question and not to the source code.

Like agreed on earlier, the next step from here on will be a meeting with Claudia. This way, I can gain insight into the workflow of creating a dashboard.

## Summarization
- No access to source code
- Hosting happens on AWS
