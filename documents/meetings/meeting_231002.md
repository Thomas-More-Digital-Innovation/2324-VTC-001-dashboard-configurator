# Meeting Report - October 2, 2023
## Content
Yesterday (October 2, 2023) the inital meeting of the 'VTC001 Dashboard Configurator' project took place via teams. I got to meet Nele, the person I have been in contact with since the beginning, and an IT co-worker of her. They explained what their business does and how I could be a part in all this. In general, they focus on polls and questionaires about really everything. By using this data, they visualize the public opinion on a certain matter. Additionally, they make it possible for people to not only answer poll questions, but add an argumentation. It's not only about raw data and the visualisation of this, but also about the stories that are behind the data.

The goal of the task is to add a dashboard view to their already existing dashboard application(s). They want to integrate a view where results of a certain poll can be shown **over the years**. This way, evolutions in how people perceive a certain concept can be displayed in an efficient way. They presented me with different tasks they would like to see fulfilled:

1. A dashboard view that displays evolutions in data over the years in a clear and structured way, by loading in external data via a .csv-file
2. Same as above, but realtime data updates by api calls via the polls app that's in the making
3. A revision of how data is displayed

Since this is the first time I dive deeper into data visualisation, I told the customer in all honesty that I don't really have clue about how long certain tasks would take. We went over my taskade goals and decided we would start things off with the first itemn, being that it is the most valuable for both parties. The moment they can meet with the developer for their app, I am to expect an invite so I can join during the meeting and ask any questions related to the 2nd pointer (realtime data updates) directly.

As mentioned earlier, the app from which the data is exported is still in the making for at least 2-3 more weeks. In the meantime, I told them I would read into all the concepts of data visualisation and already start to experiment with data they provide, together with getting familiar with the used framework (electronJS). We agreed that I would regulary keep them up-to-date about my evolution and we set a goal within 3 weeks, where I am to present my first visualisations. Since the company has a co-working space located in the city of Leuven, they mentioned it could be interesting to meet in person next time.

## Summarization
- goal = data-vis over the years by a .csv-file
- meeting in about 2 to 3 weeks for first visualisations
- regular updates on my progress
